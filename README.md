# Project 5 FPS Maze
I made this for my game tech class on Dec 10, 2022

Description
You walk around a proceduarly generated maze trying to pick up coins why avoiding a red guy who randomly spawns around the map every 10ish seconds (I really didn't want to program a path finding algorithm).

## Implementation
Rotating coins that you pick up to complete the game (there are twenty), also they are made with CSG.
A start, end, and pause menu.
A proceduraly generated maze.
An evil red guy that sends you to the end screen if you touch him.
And all the other basic stuff.
